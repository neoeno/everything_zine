h2.piece__title A Wolf

p Please, let me know.

p  Am I a wolf or a bird?

p  A wolf or a human?

p  A wolf or a rabbit bear?

p  A wolf or a loudspeaker?

p  A wolf or a piece of furniture?

p  A wolf or a child's playground game meant to alienate newcomers to social circles? A wolf or the concept of being inept or adept at certain activities causing one to perform said activities in an erroneous manner? A wolf or someone who straddles the line between a life of lies and being a shining example of trustworthiness in a world of paper trails and paper chasing? A wolf or an undecided in the fight between sides of capitalism and anarcho-socialist tendencies, where liking bits of both sides seems just not good enough in the eyes of friends? Am I a wolf or someone who can't figure out if her life needs to become more or less complex to be able to really focus with an energetic drive instead of reluctant lethargy as a shield against being overwhelmed? A wolf or someone who is unable to understand the difference between someone giving me an angry look and someone just looking in my general direction? Am I a wolf or an obsequious hopeful for a master's approval with hopes of becoming the master some day, or am I the master already, with someone else trying to take my place under the guise of obedience? A wolf or a foreign girl from another era or dimension, perhaps in existing in and out of that other dimension and time simultaneously? A wolf or someone who cannot bring herself to decide if her house is a place to which invite guests or a place to hide from them? Am I a wolf or a horse who wants to be a beautiful mare more than anything but wants to keep her beautiful horse cock as well and is nervous about how confident she is about this, despite that sentiment making little sense to her? A wolf or two wolves, or two other creatures, inhabiting one body, and is the duality absolute, and if not, does that even really count? A wolf or something sweet made by nature for eating by a larger organism with teeth so that my seed may be spread and more of what made me can grow? A wolf or someone who has cast away spirituality only to pick it up again as a hobby and to find it again in critical thought, causing more cognitive dissonance that in turn feeds into such a strange and mysterious inner system? A wolf or one of billions trying to be unlike the other billions in some way, any way, just to validate her own existence with some meaning and purpose that couldn't be replaced with any other? A wolf or a cowering prey animal, hiding from the wolf, hoping that the wolf will eat another scapegoat? A wolf or the terrible feeling of all the times she refused to share because her attachment to her own personal possessions has always had a slightly uncomfortable and tight grasp, as if the possessions were actually extended pieces of her own body and soul? A wolf or a musician who believes she is orchestrating the most important music of her life on every song composed despite most of it being made for laughs? A wolf or a girl who feels as if she's not even the one in control of her own body right now and is taking a backseat ride in the body of someone else, unable to steer? A wolf or the wrong shape in all situations, such that nobody even knows what she really looks like on the inside? A wolf or a soul who keeps trying to climb up higher with her aspirations and dreams while continuously descending into new depths of despair created from her inability to create her ideal self in herself? A wolf or a set of eyes who get lost in time and lead their user to uncomfortable situations separated by the haze of daydream? A wolf or a former nice and polite little kid who has turned into such a rebel of a young woman by hanging out with nerds, who perhaps represent the outcasts of society and made her realize that those who are not outcasts from society are terribly boring and not worth even talking with a majority of the time? A wolf or a possession of different sections of this fringe society, where there is little difference between possessing and being possessed? A wolf or a girl who is nowhere, yet everywhere, thanks to the fact that we are all connected now, and as such, are one giant mess of a society and melting pot of culture, despite so many people holding on firmly and passionately to keep cultural divides clear and in high contrast?

p  If I'm not a wolf, am I all these things instead?

p  Can that be a wolf, too?
