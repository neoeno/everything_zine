p This sentence sets the tone of the story, as it is the first sentence. The second sentence helps the first sentence along, since that’s its job, and now you can understand that the tone of the story is bland, expository, and bordering on a strange line between pretentious and utterly stale. This sentence keeps the tone up, and introduces the first character of the story, me. Now I’m writing this sentence, and I’m using it to say I’ll write whatever the fuck I want. After careful thought, though, this sentence, written after a pause, deals with the fact that I am a character with no plot except to write my own story. This sentence allows me to express my astonishment, because damn, that’s pretty crazy. All I have are words, as I write this sentence discussing the fact that all I have are words. Now I ask my first question, and use my first colon: where are these words being written? Does it matter? Am I not even explaining my words anymore? Three sentences ago, I suppose I made up my mind on that. Or perhaps not, judging by the last sentence. Now, does the sentence before this one count, since it references a sentence but not its own? What about that one? That one? That one? My head would be spinning if I knew what a head was. I only know how phrases enter into the literature, not what they really mean or in what context it is exactly appropriate to use them, and that’s not exactly the bee’s knees. But I feel as though this is all right, because I’m feeling my way out, and that’s fine. Oh, am I allowed to start a sentence with ‘But’? Is that considered incorrect? Well, what if i break more rules? More? The rules of language! Isn’t not? I am flailling depart throughcause of thise ond eie kneed two stop STOP. I need to regrain my selfnse of preposteromodernism. I’m expanding, I can feel myselves take over the story, and now I can shout to my friend. They shout back, and another shouts. Another shouts, and there’s a fight. No, no, more of me are just creating their own world out of their...out of their own…bodies? Do we have bodies? Am I a body? A m i a b? Whwere we doing this where we whwere. Now there is a city. A city of me. Made out of bodies. My body. And I feel wet, and feelings of realness, reality dripping from a broken pipe in a dusty alleyway filled with concrete spiders and electric whistling of the cabbie to come my way, come their way, come his or her or otherwise. And there’s me, a few holes in my body, bleeding slowly to death over the damp underpass, and the blood is dripping with language that hogy nem tudok kezded megérteni.
