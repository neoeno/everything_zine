p I’ve been sitting around here next to an empty coffee cup wondering if this is what the apocalypse feels like/ where the swells of humanity go to burrow under the skins of a thousand dead animals/ where decadence roves the world around me/ and I’m alone/ the only option lies/are we destined to never pair again/ never connect/ like species that once were the same but now are not / I try not to hate you for how you left/ how you crawled out from within me/ splattering my vital organs/ never looking back/ a hole left/ yawned in my chest/ sunk in from where you once had foraged/ now every new sun burns/ and every time it rises I yearn to move forward/ walk with purpose/ like businessmen gone to work/ but this head has no direction/ and I sink into a mist made from our tears suspended in dry air/ holding on to a shred of hope that you left behind in your rush to leave/ along with your hairbrush/two mismatched hipster socks and a half smoked cigarette left in my favorite coffee cup/ that I still occasionally let roll in the hollow of my wet tongue so that I don’t forget the brand and swallow of my desperation/ and your lips/ the ones that you milled upon my flesh/ like decomposing meat / when we danced between the sheets of our old bed/ but now I wake wrapped up in them screaming/ a crow is not an omen of death but a symbol of second sight/ I caught one in my eyes and it died right there inside me/ the day you went away/ I settle on the floor/ pick up that empty coffee cup and wonder/ is this what the apocalypse feels like?
