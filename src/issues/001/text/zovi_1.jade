h2.piece__title The Sisters of the Lake
p Among the sparse, frail trees and masochistic dirt of the scalloped cliffside, trodden upon by sheepish animals and even more sheepish humans, lower than animals in their own self-image, a lone robed humanoid figure sat, hunched over the edge and seeming to be peering down into the shallow waters below. The long, tattered garments ruffled and rustled in the coastal breeze, giving away the figure’s true form: the body of a woman, a young woman at that. The lines on her face, though, belied an inner image of tiredness and despair that is only found in those whose age has scraped away at their youthful happiness like the proud cliffs have been scraped away, slowly and systematically, by ages of harsh weather and crashing waves. She continued her silent and solemn gaze into the translucent shallow abyss, devoid of a single life form.
p Suddenly, something caught her eye. It was in the water. Her eyes darted in zig-zags across the morphing liquid terrain of the rippling waves. She absolutely saw it—the look in her eyes changed from one that had given up hope long ago to one springing with youthful curiosity. The glimmer in her eye sharpened, and she rose, gaining her footing after unsteadily slipping slightly on the unstable silt deposit she was now towering over, her long robes now fully unfurled. It was time for her. She slammed her right foot down and slid down the hill with intense force, creating a slice in the scallop pattern of the steep cliffside as she made her way down to the water below. 
p A voice called out from behind her. It was a young girl, a few years younger, perhaps, than the one now at the water’s edge. “Please don’t go,” the young girl’s voice cried over the ledge. If the older one looked back, she would not have been able to see the originator of the voice, but she had no intention of doing so. She knew full well who it was.
p “I am going. It is my time to go, my sister,” she said, loudly and clearly, with purpose that even gave herself fleeting chills. She found that she was knee-deep in water, now—she had been walking forward slowly and had not realized it until this moment. She felt relieved that her legs knew what to do in this situation.
p “But…”
p “It is what I must do.” She needed to stand firm, despite that “But…” sounding on the verge of tears. She no longer needed tears, she reasoned with herself. She had all the salty water she ever needed at her hips and below, now, as she continued to wade into the water.
p After some silence, the voice of her sister returned, with much more desperation than before. “Don’t you remember what happened to your older sisters?”
p “Yes, they were brave. Incredibly so.” Calm, collected, as she should be, the water to her waist.
p “Brave? They—”
p “—They fought for their family, so that their younger sisters could live a good life,” the older sister quickly snapped, slightly irritated, but still focused on moving forward. 
p Her voice quavering, the younger of the two shouted, “What did they fight? What good life? Do you even know?”
p “I will soon.” The water was over her chest, now.
p “No!”
p That “No!” was very much closer and louder than the earlier shouts, the older sister noticed. She heard splashing behind her. It came closer, and more frantic. She stopped, starting to turn around, only to be pushed into by her younger sister, who, half-drowning already, kept propelling herself forward with an anguished flailing of arms. After another second and a few seconds after her older sister was able to understand what had happened, her younger sister was completely submerged, and no trace of her was to be found on the surface. Her mouth open with a mortified look stricken on her paled face, the older sister stood motionless and stared at the lapping waves. She started to add salt water to the already abundant and vast quantity around her, shaking and praying that it would not overflow.
